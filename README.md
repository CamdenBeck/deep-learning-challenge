# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview
This project involves building and training a deep learning model to predict outcomes based on a given dataset. The challenge is to preprocess the data, build a neural network, and evaluate its performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Camden/deep-learning-challenge.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd deep-learning-challenge
    ```

## Usage
If you want to run this project locally, run the [Deep_Learning.ipynb](/Deep_Learning.ipynb) file:
```bash
jupyter notebook Deep_Learning.ipynb
```
However, it is recommended to upload and run this file in Google Colab, and run it from there.
